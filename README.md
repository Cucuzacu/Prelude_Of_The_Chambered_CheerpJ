# Prelude_Of_The_Chambered_CheerpJ
Run Prelude Of The Chambered online!!!!(the code has been modified for CheerpJ).
You might also want to check http://github.com/cucuzacu/Minicraft_CheerpJ/ and http://github.com/cucuzacu/minicraft_GODMODE/. That is my port of Minicraft to the web, which was also initially incompatible with CheerpJ.
You need to have the CheerpJ Applet Runner extension installed and you also have to host the files on a web server to play this!
